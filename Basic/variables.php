/**
 * Definition and Usage:
 *    Variables are "containers" for storing information.
 * In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by
 * the name of the variable.
 *
 *
 * Rules:
 *    1. A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
 *    2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
 *    3. A variable name cannot start with a number
 *    4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
 *    5. Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
